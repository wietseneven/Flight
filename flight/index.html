                    <p>Adam is from Darfur, where violent raids on civilians seen as supporting the Darfuri rebel have increased dramatically in the last three years. Many of his people are in refugee camps in Chad, or displace in Darfur. Battles there are ongoing between the goverment and the rebels.</p>

                    <h4>Tijani</h4>
                    <p>Tijani is the recently elected governor of North Darfur. He grew up in Nyala, the son of a Rizegat father, and a Fur mother. He was a former Rebel fighting against the government, but his militia signed the Doha agreement in 2011 along with a few other armed groups. He was sidelined at first by the government, and called a traitor by other rebels who were still fighting. But recent negotiations between the goverment and rebels has put him in power. He vowed to bring peace and growth in Darfur, but he has little experience and has been investigated for corruption.</p>

                    <p>Kuku is a 13 year old boy living in the Nuba mountains. The area has been at war since 2011, when government troops attacked the SPLA-N rebels in the region. He has grown up under a brutal government bombing campaign. Antanov cargo planes have dropped nearly 4000 bombs on civilian areas since 2012. While the local government attempts to offer education, slowly another generation of young people is being lost to war.</p>

                    <p>Salome is a young student activist from Eritrea.
                      She, like many Eritreans, is fleeing the repressive regime in her country.  The first Eritrean refugees arrived in Sudan in 1968, and over a 1000 refugees continue to cross the border to Sudan every month.  Sudan is also a transit destination for many, on their migration journey.  Women migrants face a particularly perilous journey in their search for safe havens.</p>

            <p class="lead">Imagine if 10% of your country was displaced. Some are refugees in foreign countries, most are displaced in their own country.
              In Sudan this is the case.</p>
            <p>Over 3 million people have fled war, political persecution, and land grabbing. With the countries conflicts still raging and democratic reforms a long way off most arenâ€™t going home anytime soon. The impact of this on the region and the world is tremendous.  The European Union has offered 1,8 million in  financial, technical and political incentives to manage and control migration from Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia to Europe.</p>
            <p>We need to stop this bad incentives policy.  We need to stop the way migrants are seen.</p>
